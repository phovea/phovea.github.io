Phovea is a framework for quickly developing bioinformatics visualization applications on the web.
Phovea can be used as client-only Javascript library, or as a tightly coupled client-server system.
Phovea provides datatypes and basic visualization for genomic data, and it provides
infrastructure for managing data, synchronizing views, and tracking user actions.


All core client-side code in Phovea is written as TypeScript, which helps avoid errors which
loosely-typed Javascript is prone to. Server-side code is written in the light-weight Flask framework
for Python.

Phovea is created and maintained by the [Caleydo Team](http://www.caleydo.org/), which has
used the ideas behind Phovea to create a number of [tools](http://www.caleydo.org/tools/).
